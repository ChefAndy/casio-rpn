Python script for the scientific Numworks calculator, enabling to type in RPN in a graphical user interface.

The basic operations are mapped to the usual buttons.
The [Toolbox] button allows the user to display some other hotkeys, including RPN-specific functions as ROLL, SWAP or DUPlicate, or prime factorisation or converting degrees from/to radians, or Fahrenheit/Celsius.

On [x,n,t] key, the user may choose between two RPN variants:
- either X,Y,Z,T,L levels with dropping of oldest inputs, and L keeping the last value;
- either dynamic levels 1,2,3,â€¦ with infinite amount of inputs.
