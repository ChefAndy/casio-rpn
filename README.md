Python script for the scientific Numworks calculator, enabling to type in RPN in a graphical user interface.

The basic operations are mapped to the usual buttons.
The [Toolbox] button allows the user to display some other hotkeys, including RPN-specific functions as ROTation, SWAP or DUPlicate, or prime factorisation or converting degrees from/to radians, or Fahrenheit/Celsius.
